!What is the moldable editor made of
This very document is rendered using the moldable editor.

There are three layers that make the editor: 
- In Sparta: A low level text model, font handling, text measurements, the generic rope data structure. This has little to do with the editor per se, but should be considered an object-oriented replacement to what would otherwise be an FFI call.
- In Bloc: Basic text element, rope text, paragraph model, text attributes, infinite list.
- In Brick: The interactive editor part.

Let's take them one by one.
!!Sparta text support
The Sparta text support is concerned with drawing actual text on a canvas.

A specific concern is placed on pixel perfect text measurements that can be controlled from the image.

!!Bloc text model
Bloc introduces ${class:BlTextElement}$, the basic piece in a text editor.
!!Brick editor
